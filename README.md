# Chrome-Extension-Real-Time-Audio-Transcription
A Chrome extension that captures audio from the current tab, streams/transcribes in 30‑second chunks (with a 3‑second overlap), and displays live results in a Side Panel. Includes multi‑tab capture, channel labeling (Tab vs Mic), offline buffering, and robust UX/error handling.

---

## ✨ Features

- Capture audio from **audible tabs** and optionally **microphone** at the same time.
- Rolling **30s segments with 3s overlap** to avoid word loss between chunks.
- **Live tab add/remove** while recording — toggle checkboxes to start/stop channels.
- **Status & timer** UI; **Copy / Download (.txt & .json)** exports.
- Resilient **retry queue** for transient network issues (e.g., brief disconnects).
- Uses **Google Gemini (gemini-1.5-flash-latest)** via the Generative Language API.

**Key Decisions**
- **MV3 Service Worker** to avoid blocking UI; does chunking and API calls.
- **3-second overlap**: retains the final 3s chunk each window to minimize word boundary loss.
- **Retry**: up to 3 attempts with exponential backoff.
- **Storage**: local key storage via `chrome.storage.local`.
- **Optional Backend**: proxy keeps API key server-side (production-friendly).

**Channels / Labeling (extensible)**
- Current build focuses on tab audio, Microphone and multi-tab capture added by extending capture routing and labeling logic.
