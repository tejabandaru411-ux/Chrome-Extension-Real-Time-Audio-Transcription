# Chrome-Extension-Real-Time-Audio-Transcription
A Chrome extension that captures audio from the current tab, streams/transcribes in 30â€‘second chunks (with a 3â€‘second overlap), and displays live results in a Side Panel. Includes multiâ€‘tab capture, channel labeling (Tab vs Mic), offline buffering, and robust UX/error handling.

- **Status & timer** UI; **Copy / Download (.txt & .json)** exports.
- Resilient **retry queue** for transient network issues (e.g., brief disconnects).

- **Chunking:** Creates a new `MediaRecorder` segment every **30s**, each recording **33s** (3s overlap).
- **Transcribe:** Sends Base64 audio to Gemini endpoint:
