# Chrome-Extension-Real-Time-Audio-Transcription
A Chrome extension that captures audio from the current tab, streams/transcribes in 30â€‘second chunks (with a 3â€‘second overlap), and displays live results in a Side Panel. Includes multiâ€‘tab capture, channel labeling (Tab vs Mic), offline buffering, and robust UX/error handling.

## âœ¨ Features

- Capture audio from **audible tabs** and optionally **microphone** at the same time.
- Rolling **30s segments with 3s overlap** to avoid word loss between chunks.
- **Live tab add/remove** while recording â€” toggle checkboxes to start/stop channels.
- **Status & timer** UI; **Copy / Download (.txt & .json)** exports.
- Resilient **retry queue** for transient network issues (e.g., brief disconnects).
- Uses **Google Gemini (gemini-1.5-flash-latest)** via the Generative Language API.
